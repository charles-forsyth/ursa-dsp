    "title": "Executive Summary",
    "content": "The **Sanitization Test** project, led by Principal Investigator Chuck Forsyth within the Department of Research Computing, involves the final verification of a sanitized output pipeline utilizing sensitive infrastructure data regarding California urban centers provided by the State of California. Due to the **Protection Level 4 (P4)** classification of the dataset, the project employs a strict security posture compliant with university and state standards.\n\nAll sensitive data will be received via secure transfer methods and stored exclusively within a segregated, encrypted **cloud environment (AWS/GCP)** running a hardened Linux operating system. Data analysis will occur solely within this secure cloud infrastructure. To mitigate risk, **no P4 data will be downloaded to local workstations, laptops, or portable storage media**. Access is strictly limited to the Principal Investigator and authorized research staff listed in this plan.\n\nThe data will be retained until the project retention date of **2030-01-01**. Upon expiration of this period or the conclusion of the research, all data and associated storage volumes will be destroyed using **DoD-compliant wiping procedures** to ensure the information is irretrievable."
