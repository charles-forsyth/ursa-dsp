        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This research project, titled "CRISPR Gene Editing Research," is conducted by Principal Investigator Dr. Jennifer Doudna within the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology. The study utilizes sensitive patient data provided by the UCSF Medical Center, which is classified under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). To ensure strict compliance with HIPAA regulations and university security standards, the research team has implemented a hybrid infrastructure strategy.</p>
<p>Primary data storage and analysis occur on a secured local server, while redundant backups are maintained in a secure Cloud environment (AWS S3). Data transfer from UCSF is conducted exclusively via encrypted secure transfer methods (SFTP/HTTPS). Strict security controls, including encryption at rest and in transit, access control lists based on the principle of least privilege, and regular logging, are enforced to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data.</p>
<p>All data associated with this project will be retained until the project's conclusion on December 31, 2026. Upon termination of the project, all data will be securely destroyed in accordance with NIST 800-88 Media Sanitization Guidelines.</p>

<p>Service Provider personnel (including Systems Team and ISO as needed) will validate the following controls using this plan as a baseline:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure (AWS):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>IAM Access:</strong> Audit AWS IAM roles and policies to ensure the principle of least privilege is maintained.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Security:</strong> Verify AWS S3 bucket policies to ensure <strong>Block Public Access</strong> is enabled and default encryption (AES-256) is active for all backup data.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Logs:</strong> Review AWS CloudTrail logs to identify any unauthorized API calls or configuration changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Local Server (Linux):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>System Logs:</strong> Review system logs (e.g., <code>/var/log/auth.log</code>, <code>syslog</code>) for anomalies, specifically checking for unauthorized SSH access attempts or privilege escalation (sudo usage).</li>
<li><strong>File Integrity:</strong> Compare file system audit logs for directories containing HIPAA data to verify that no accounts other than system accounts and approved researchers have accessed protected files.</li>
<li><strong>Malware Protection:</strong> Review endpoint protection or antivirus logs (e.g., Trellix/ClamAV) to identify any malware threats.</li>
<li><strong>Patching:</strong> Confirm that the OS and research applications are updated with the latest security patches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Access Verification:</strong><ul>
<li>The PI (Dr. Jennifer Doudna) shall validate the current list of authorized users and permissions for both the local server and AWS environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reporting and Remediation</strong></p>
<p>Any deviations from the configuration specified in this plan or anomalies identified in the logs will be reported immediately to the PI and UISL, who will determine required remediation. Any suspected security incident or breach of HIPAA data will be escalated to the Information Security Office (ISO) immediately. At the completion of maintenance, the local server will be returned to its secure operational state.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention &amp; Destruction</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>UC Requirement: When handling Institutional Information classified at Protection Level 3 or higher, Workforce Members may need to employ stronger methods of disposal at a more granular level to ensure that data is truly irretrievable. (Disposal of Institutional Information)</p>
<ul>
<li>At the conclusion of the research period approved by UCSF Medical Center (currently scheduled for 2026-12-31), including any term extensions to the original agreement, all HIPAA-regulated data will be securely deleted from UC Riverside systems and AWS infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Local Server Sanitization:</strong> The storage on the local Linux server will be sanitized using tools and methods compliant with <strong>NIST 800-88 Media Sanitization Guidelines</strong> (e.g., Clear, Purge, or Destroy techniques). If the hardware is to be decommissioned, physical destruction of the media will be performed.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Sanitization (AWS):</strong> Data residing in AWS S3 will be deleted. To ensure data is truly irretrievable, the specific AWS KMS (Key Management Service) encryption keys used to protect the S3 buckets will be securely deleted (Crypto-shredding), rendering any residual data unrecoverable.</li>
<li><strong>Backups:</strong> Any local backups or encrypted USB drives will be sanitized in accordance with NIST 800-88 standards. Cloud backups will be destroyed via the deletion of the associated encryption keys.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Logs:</strong> File access and security logs will be retained for six (6) years from the conclusion of the research period to comply with HIPAA retention requirements. After the retention period, logs will be securely destroyed.</li>

        <h2>Security Plan Review</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This plan will be reviewed at least annually by the Principal Investigator (Dr. Jennifer Doudna) and the Unit Information Security Lead (UISL) to verify continued compliance with HIPAA regulations and university standards. Any risks identified will be added to the security plan following the process defined under Security Plan Changes.</p>
<p>During the review process, the PI will review the list of people with access to the data and ensure that access is revoked for any who no longer require access. This review specifically includes:
*   Validating physical access permissions to the local server.
*   Auditing logical access to AWS S3 storage buckets.
*   Verifying that only current, authorized personnel hold decryption keys for the UCSF Medical Center data.</p>
