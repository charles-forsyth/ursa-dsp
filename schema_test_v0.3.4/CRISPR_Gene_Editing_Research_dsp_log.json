    "title": "Executive Summary",
    "content": "This research project, titled \"CRISPR Gene Editing Research,\" is conducted by Principal Investigator Dr. Jennifer Doudna within the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology. The study utilizes sensitive patient data provided by the UCSF Medical Center, which is classified under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). To ensure strict compliance with HIPAA regulations and university security standards, the research team has implemented a hybrid infrastructure strategy.\n\nPrimary data storage and analysis occur on a secured local server, while redundant backups are maintained in a secure Cloud environment (AWS S3). Data transfer from UCSF is conducted exclusively via encrypted secure transfer methods (SFTP/HTTPS). Strict security controls, including encryption at rest and in transit, access control lists based on the principle of least privilege, and regular logging, are enforced to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data.\n\nAll data associated with this project will be retained until the project's conclusion on December 31, 2026. Upon termination of the project, all data will be securely destroyed in accordance with NIST 800-88 Media Sanitization Guidelines."
