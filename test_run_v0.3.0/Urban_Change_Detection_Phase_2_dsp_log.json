    "content": "This project, \"Urban Change Detection Phase 2,\" led by Dr. Sarah Connor of the Department of Geospatial Sciences, involves the analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery provided by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The data is classified as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). To comply with strict data security standards (NIST 800-171), all data storage and processing will occur exclusively on a dedicated air-gapped server running the Linux operating system, located physically within the Secure Research Lab. The server is strictly isolated from all public and campus networks to prevent unauthorized remote access.\n\nData will be transferred to the secure environment via authorized Secure Transfer methods managed by the Unit Information Security Lead (UISL), John Smith. Researchers are prohibited from removing data from the air-gapped server or transferring it to personal devices, laptops, or unauthorized external storage. All CUI data will be retained until the project retention date of 2030-01-01. Upon conclusion of the retention period, the data and storage media will be destroyed using a DoD-compliant wipe (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M) to render the information irretrievable."

    "title": "Executive Summary",
    "content": "The 'Urban Change Detection Phase 2' project, led by Principal Investigator Dr. Sarah Connor within the Department of Geospatial Sciences, involves the analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery to detect longitudinal changes in urban infrastructure. The data supporting this research is provided by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and is classified as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Due to the sensitivity of the data, this Data Security Plan (DSP) implements strict security controls aligned with NIST 800-171 and CMMC standards.\n\nAll CUI data will be stored and processed exclusively on a dedicated air-gapped server running the Linux operating system, located within the physically secured Secure Research Lab. This infrastructure is isolated from all public and private networks to prevent unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration. Data ingestion will occur via approved secure transfer methods. Access to the air-gapped environment is restricted solely to authorized personnel listed in this plan. Data will be retained until January 1, 2030, after which it will be destroyed using a Department of Defense (DoD) compliant wiping standard."

    "title": "Configuration of Secured Computing and Storage",
    "content": "### Access Control\n**Objective:** Limit access to Institutional Information and IT Resources.\n\n**UC and Project Requirements (NIST 800-171/CMMC)**\n*   **Local Console Access Only:** Due to the air-gapped configuration, no remote access (e.g., RDP, SSH, VNC) is permitted. Access to the server is restricted to the physical console located in the Secure Research Lab.\n*   **Account Management:** Unique local user accounts will be provisioned only for the PI and authorized Project Researchers listed in this plan. Guest or shared accounts are strictly prohibited.\n*   **Authentication:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) or strong password policies meeting UC Class 4 standards (minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements) will be enforced for local login. \n*   **Least Privilege:** Administrative (root/sudo) access is restricted to the designated Unit IT Director/UISL (John Smith) for maintenance purposes. Researchers will hold standard user privileges.\n*   **Session Termination:** Automatic screen locking will be enabled after 15 minutes of inactivity, requiring re-authentication to unlock.\n\n### Encryption\n**Objective:** Ensure appropriate access to protect UC Institutional Information and IT Resources.\n\n**Controls**\n*   **Data at Rest:** The Linux server storage volumes will be encrypted using LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) with AES-256 encryption. This includes swap partitions to prevent data leakage.\n*   **Removable Media:** Any external media used for data ingress/egress (e.g., for transferring NGA data or updates) must be encrypted using FIPS 140-2 compliant algorithms (AES-256).\n*   **Key Management:** Encryption keys/passphrases will be managed by the UISL and stored in a secure, separate location from the hardware.\n\n### Physical and Environmental Security\n**Objective:** Ensure appropriate physical access to protect UC IT Resources and Institutional Information.\n\n**Controls**\n*   **Location:** The air-gapped server is physically located in the Secure Research Lab within the Department of Geospatial Sciences.\n*   **Access Controls:** Entry to the lab is controlled via electronic key card and/or physical key, restricted to authorized personnel. A physical access log will be maintained.\n*   **Monitoring:** The server room is monitored by 24/7 video surveillance. The server itself will be physically secured (e.g., locked rack or Kensington lock) to prevent removal.\n*   **Hardware Security:** All physical ports not required for operation (e.g., unused USB ports) will be physically blocked or logically disabled in the BIOS/OS.\n\n### Protection from Malware and Intrusion\n**Controls**\n*   **Antivirus:** The server will run Linux-compatible antivirus software (e.g., ClamAV). Since the system is air-gapped, virus definitions will be manually updated monthly via secure, scanned removable media by the UISL.\n*   **File Integrity Monitoring:** A file integrity monitoring tool (e.g., AIDE) will be installed to detect unauthorized changes to system binaries and configuration files.\n*   **Media Scanning:** Any removable media introduced to the environment must be scanned for malware on a separate, isolated scanning station before being connected to the air-gapped server.\n\n### Backup\n**Controls**\n*   **Method:** Backups of CUI data will be performed manually onto encrypted external hard drives.\n*   **Storage:** Backup media will be stored in a GSA-approved security container or a locked fireproof safe separate from the server location, accessible only by the PI and UISL.\n*   **Retention:** Backups will be retained according to the project lifecycle and NGA requirements, then destroyed via DoD-approved wipe methods.\n\n### Logging and Auditing\n**Objective:** Proper logging and monitoring are required practices for recording events and generating evidence.\n\n**Controls**\n*   **Local Logging:** The Linux Audit framework (auditd) will be configured to log security-relevant events, including successful/failed logins, privilege escalation (sudo), and file access modification.\n*   **Log Retention:** Logs will be retained locally for at least one year. Due to the air-gapped nature of the system, logs cannot be exported to a central SIEM; therefore, the UISL will conduct a manual review of logs on a monthly basis.\n*   **Audit Trails:** The system will maintain an automated audit trail sufficient to reconstruct security-relevant events.\n\n### Control of Operational Software\n**Controls**\n*   **Whitelisting:** Only software explicitly required for the analysis of satellite imagery (e.g., QGIS, GDAL, Python scientific stack) and system maintenance is permitted. \n*   **Installation Restrictions:** Software installation capabilities are restricted to the UISL (root user). Researchers cannot install or modify system software.\n*   **Port Control:** USB ports are logically restricted to allow only authorized, encrypted mass storage devices identified by hardware ID, preventing the use of unauthorized peripherals.\n\n### Vulnerability & Patch Management\n**Controls**\n*   **Manual Patching:** Due to the lack of internet connectivity, the UISL will implement a monthly maintenance cycle. Security patches for the Linux OS and application software will be downloaded to secure media on a connected workstation, scanned, and manually applied to the air-gapped server.\n*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** The UISL will perform periodic vulnerability assessments using portable scanning tools or local agents to verify the security posture.\n\n### Communications Security\n**Objective:** Ensure the security of Institutional Information regarding network isolation.\n\n**Controls**\n*   **Air-Gap Enforcement:** All network interface cards (NICs), including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, will be physically removed or disabled at the BIOS and OS kernel level.\n*   **Isolation:** The server will have no physical or logical connection to the campus network, the public Internet, or any other system.\n*   **Data Transfer:** Data transfer from the NGA to the server will occur solely via the approved Secure Transfer method (encrypted physical media), following strict chain-of-custody procedures."

    "title": "Transfer of Data from [EXTERNAL PARTY] to UC Riverside",
    "content": "1. **Data Encryption and Preparation**: Before transmission to UC Riverside, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) will encrypt the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) data in ZIP format utilizing AES-256 encryption. The encryption passphrase shall be unique and consist of no less than 10 alphanumeric characters, strictly excluding common words, phrases, or names.\n\n2. **Initial Transmission**: The encrypted ZIP file will be stored in a secure Microsoft 365 SharePoint repository and shared with the Unit Information Security Lead (UISL). The encryption passphrase for the ZIP file will be transmitted separately to the UISL via telephone (out-of-band communication).\n\n3. **Transfer to Portable Media**: Once the encrypted ZIP file has been accessed by the UISL, it will be downloaded and copied directly onto a dedicated encrypted USB flash drive.\n\n4. **Transfer to Secure Infrastructure**: The UISL will physically transport the encrypted USB flash drive to the Secure Research Lab. The encrypted ZIP file will be transferred to the air-gapped Linux server (secured analysis computer), retaining the encrypted copy on the USB flash drive.\n\n5. **Decryption**: The UISL will decrypt the ZIP file solely on the air-gapped Linux server.\n\n6. **Backup and Key Management**: The UISL will provide the encrypted USB flash drive to the Principal Investigator (PI) to serve as a backup of the original data, along with the encryption key for the USB drive (distinct from the ZIP file passphrase). The USB flash drive will be stored in a locked location (e.g., desk drawer in the PI\u2019s office), and the encryption key for the USB drive will be stored in a separate locked location to ensure physical separation of the cryptographic key and the encrypted media. The UISL will escrow the encryption passphrase for the ZIP file in a secure, institutional password management system. In the event of a failure of the secured analysis computer, the PI may contact the UISL to perform data recovery.\n\n7. **Verification and Sanitization**: The PI will confirm the successful data decryption and integrity on the air-gapped server. Upon this confirmation, the UISL will securely destroy the copy residing on SharePoint in accordance with NIST 800-88 media sanitization guidelines."

    "title": "Operational Use of Secured Analysis Computer",
    "content": "### Operational Use of Secured Analysis Computer (Air-Gapped Server)\n\n**1. Secure Environment and Isolation**\nThe secured analysis computer is a standalone, air-gapped Linux server located in the Secure Research Lab. It is physically isolated from the university network and the internet to ensure the confidentiality of the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) provided by the NGA. No network interfaces (wired or wireless) will be enabled during the storage or processing of the data.\n\n**2. Data Transfer Procedures**\nTo maintain the air-gapped integrity of the system, the following procedures regarding the use of removable media will be strictly enforced:\n\n*   **Dedicated Media:** A FIPS 140-2 compliant encrypted USB flash drive will be provisioned specifically for project use. This drive is distinct and separate from the flash drive used for the backup of the original data.\n*   **Exclusive Transfer Method:** Only this specific encrypted drive will be used to move data, scripts, or outputs to or from the secured analysis computer.\n*   **Key Management:** Only the Principal Investigator (Dr. Sarah Connor) and approved researchers listed in this Data Security Plan will have access to the encryption key or passphrase for the encrypted USB flash drive.\n\n**3. Restrictions on Data Movement**\n*   **Data Ingress:** Only statistical analysis scripts, code, or approved software updates intended for use in the project's specific analytical workflow will be copied from other computers to the encrypted USB flash drive for transfer to the secured server. All files will be scanned for malware prior to introduction to the air-gapped environment.\n*   **Data Egress:** Only aggregated, de-identified data (e.g., summary statistics, charts, or non-sensitive outputs) will be copied from the secured analysis computer to the encrypted USB flash drive for use in other applications or reporting.\n*   **Prohibited Content:** No other data sets, applications, executables, documents, or files other than those explicitly noted above will be copied to or from the secured analysis computer.\n\n**4. Operational Exceptions**\nAny operational need to remove un-aggregated, identifiable data or raw CUI from the secured analysis computer must be approved in advance, in writing, by both the PI and the Unit Information Security Lead (John Smith)."
