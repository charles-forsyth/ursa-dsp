    "title": "Executive Summary",
    "content": "Project Poseidon: Mapping the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, led by Principal Investigator Dr. Arthur Curry within the Department of Oceanography, involves the analysis of high-resolution sonar data provided by the **Atlantis Marine Institute**. This data is classified as **Export Controlled** and **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)**. To meet the stringent security requirements associated with this classification, this Data Security Plan outlines a dedicated, isolated computing environment.\n\nAll research data will be stored and processed exclusively on a **Standalone Linux Workstation** located within a secured facility in the Oceanography Department. This workstation is configured as an air-gapped system with **no internet connectivity** or connection to campus networks. Data transfers to and from the secure workstation will be conducted solely via **Encrypted SSDs** (Solid State Drives). No project data will be stored on cloud services, shared network drives, or unencrypted portable media. At the conclusion of the research, all data storage media will be sanitized in accordance with **DoD 5220.22-M** standards to ensure irretrievability."

The encryption passphrase shall be unique and be no less than 15 alphanumeric characters. It shall not include common words, phrases, or any names.\n3. The Encrypted SSD will be physically transported to the UISL (**Mera**) via a secure courier service with tracking and signature validation required.\n4. The encryption key for the SSD will be transmitted to the UISL via telephone or a secure out-of-band communication method.\n5. Once the Encrypted SSD has been received by the UISL, it will be secured in a locked location until it is transferred to the secured analysis computer.\n6. The UISL will connect the Encrypted SSD directly to the **secured analysis computer** (Standalone Linux Workstation).\n7. The UISL will decrypt the files on the secured analysis computer (which is itself encrypted).\n8. The Encrypted SSD will be provided to the PI (**Dr. Arthur Curry**) to serve as a backup of the original data. The SSD will be stored in a locked location (e.g., desk drawer or safe in the PI\u2019s office), and the encryption key will be kept in a locked location separate from the SSD.\n9. The UISL will escrow the encryption key for the SSD in a secure password management system.

Security patches, OS updates, and antivirus definitions will be transferred and applied manually using authorized, virus-scanned encrypted SSDs.\n*   **Log Review:** All system, application, and security logs (e.g., `/var/log/audit/audit.log`, `/var/log/secure`, or `/var/log/auth.log`) collected since the previous maintenance window will be reviewed for anomalies. Specific attention will be paid to failed login attempts, privilege escalation (sudo usage), and file access events.\n*   **Peripheral Auditing:** System logs will be analyzed to verify that only the authorized Encrypted SSDs have been connected to the workstation. Any connection of unapproved USB devices or peripherals will be flagged.\n*   **Account Verification:** The local user list will be audited to ensure only the Principal Investigator and approved researchers listed in this plan have active accounts. Inactive accounts will be disabled or removed.\n*   **File Integrity:** File system audit logs for directories containing CUI will be reviewed to verify that permissions remain restricted to authorized personnel.\n\nAny deviations from the configuration specified in this plan, evidence of unapproved peripheral connections, or anomalies identified in the logs will be reported immediately to the PI (Dr. Arthur Curry) and the UISL (Mera). The UISL will determine required remediation and escalate any suspected security incident or breach to the Information Security Office (ISO)."
