    "body": "This document should be completed by the Unit Information Security Lead (UISL) or Unit IT Director. It will be reviewed by an ISO team member (\"ISO Assessor\").\n\nThe Lab Director and/or researchers are responsible for providing data security requirements to the UISL or Unit IT Director.\nThe Unit IT Service Provider is responsible for determining and implementing technical solutions.\n\nThe technical solution must meet or exceed the UC IS-3 policy (https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000543/BFB-IS-3), UC Minimum Security Standard (https://security.ucop.edu/files/documents/policies/minimum-security-standard.pdf) and the standard required by the external party.\n\nThe UC IS-3 policy requires all researchers to \"develop and follow an information security plan that manages security risk over the course of their project.\"\n\nEach section contains IS-3 requirements and example controls. Units should complete the controls to meet or exceed all data security requirements. Controls implemented to meet external party requirements should be listed in the appropriate rows.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this form, contact the Information Security Office Risk Team at iso-risk@ucr.edu."

    "body": "The purpose of this data security plan (\"Plan\") is to document the security measures and policies for handling data shared with the Principal Investigator (\"PI\") by the [NAME OF EXTERNAL PARTY]. If this agreement is executed, all members of the research team with access to the data are contractually obligated to follow all aspects of the plan. The goal of the protections outlined in the plan is to prevent persons who are not signatories, or otherwise authorized, from gaining access to the data.\n\nThis plan applies to both raw data received, any copies of the raw data and any derivatives and output of analysis thereof."

    "title": "Transfer of Data from [EXTERNAL PARTY] to UC Riverside",
    "body": "[This is a sample data transfer method. Alter as necessary.]\nBefore being transmitted to UC Riverside, [EXTERNAL PARTY] will encrypt the data in ZIP format with AES-256 encryption.\nThe encryption passphrase shall be unique and be no less than 10 alphanumeric characters. It shall not include common words, phrases or any names.\nThe encrypted file will be stored in SharePoint and shared with the UISL. \nThe encryption key for the file will be transmitted to the UISL via telephone. \nOnce the encrypted file has been received by the UISL, it will be copied to an encrypted USB flash drive.\nThe UISL will transfer the encrypted file to the secured analysis computer, retaining the encrypted copy on the encrypted USB flash drive.\nThe UISL will decrypt the encrypted file on the secured analysis computer (which is itself encrypted).\nThe UISL will provide the encrypted USB flash drive to the PI as a backup of the original data, along with the drive (NOT the ZIP file) encryption key. The USB flash drive will be stored in a locked location (desk drawer in PI\u2019s office), and the encryption key for the USB drive will be kept in a locked location separate from the USB drive.  \nThe UISL will escrow the encryption key for the ZIP file in a secure password management system. Should the ZIP file need to be decrypted in the future (e.g., in the case of a failure of the secured analysis computer), the PI may contact the UISL to perform the decryption.\nThe PI will confirm the successful data decryption on the secured analysis computer, after which the UISL will destroy the SharePoint copy."

Modify based on UC and external party requirements.]\nAt least once every three months, Service Provider personnel will perform maintenance on the secured analysis computer, consisting of the elements described in this section.\nDuring this maintenance window, the on-board network interface will be temporarily re-enabled, and the computer will be connected to the campus network via a NAT router/firewall, which will be used to prevent access to the computer from other network devices. \nThe maintenance will be tracked as an Incident record in the UC Riverside ITS ServiceNow instance, including a completed checklist of all required actions (see required actions below).\nAny deviations from the configuration specified in this plan or anomalies identified in the logs will be reported to the PI and UISL who will determine any required remediation and escalate any suspected security incident or breach to the ISO.\nAt the completion of the maintenance, the computer will be disconnected from the network, and the network interface will be disabled as described in Network Access.\nAll system, application and security logs collected since the previous maintenance window will be reviewed for anomalies and security issues.\nThe file system audit logs for the directories containing the data protected by this plan will be compared to verify that no accounts other than system accounts and accounts held by approved researchers have accessed the protected directories.\nEndpoint protection or antivirus logs will be reviewed to identify any malware threats or connection of unapproved peripherals."
